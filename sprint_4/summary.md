## Reflection and Summary



### Major Changes and Achievements

This sprint mainly involved tiding up the permissions update and fixing some bugs. I also implemented a few features related to the permissions update after receiving feedback from users, such as the `/config permissions quickstart` command. The permissions pull request was merged at the end of this sprint.  
I also updated the documentation that related to the permissions features, and receiving feedback and updated that. 

### Reflection

This sprint was not that productive, mainly due to some days away due to school trips and other things, meaning I didn't have as much time as usual to work on the project. However I still managed to do a fair amount of work, and get the permissions changes merged.



## Testing

### Feedback on docs

This feedback was implemented on the site.

### Feedback on the permissions system

This was feedback on the permissions system and current system, however I didn't not change anything regarding this (and the last two points were already implemented). 

### My response

### Other feedback

I also recived feedback over a voice call, (which I cannot show as it wasn't recorded). 
This was in regards to the useablity of the system, and led to some of the changes such as adding the permissions quickstart command, and seperating out the permission values in the representation. 


## Notes for next sprint

Next sprint I will tidy stuff up, like for example the sending flow / and possibly implement an embeds feature. I will also touch up the docs, and make sure they are ready to be published. I would like to aim for a release of this version near the end of the sprint.
