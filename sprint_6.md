## Reflection and Summary

### Major Changes and Achievements

(this is in time order)

- Add embeds editing / sending. This was a major piece of work.
- Minor fixes and style changes
- Fix sentry logging
- Released new interactions version to production
- Fixed an issue where mobile users couldn't use context menus (discord's end), and so added slash commands for compatiblity
- Fixed another issue where webhooks being deleted wasn't handled
- Added a command to get the format of mentions, to make it easier to use.

### Reflection

I think I did pretty well this sprint, managing to get the release out pretty smoothly, with only a few issues that I sorted out quickly.
This is even though for the first week I was unable to do much work as I caught the flu (the sprint was also extended to the end of the term).

## Testing

There was a lot of testing, and feedback from users this time round.

### Feedback and testing from testers before release

Not much here was actioned, but it did reassure me there weren't any really bad bugs.

### Feedback after release from general users

This issue was fixed

## Notes for next sprint

Next sprint I need to focus on getting stuff done.
