## Reflection and Summary

### Reflection

I think that overall this sprint was very productive and I now know the design process I will be going through. I will be using figma to create mockups, and prototyping and then using those to create the final design in Next.js.

### Major Changes and Achievements

- Desktop profile mockups - Including different states (logged out, logged in unexpanded, and logged in expanded)
- Mobile profile mockups - Including different states (logged out and logged in)

## Testing

I asked for feedback while designing the different profile states.
I did this by asking for feedback from classmates, and creating different mockups for different design ideas.

For example for the mobile version of mockups I asked for feedback on what order the profile and links should be in, and changed my initial idea from the profile at the bottom to the login button below the profile.

I also got feedback for the desktop version, which changed my design idea from having a floating state for the dropdown, to having a permanent separated portion that expands.

### Summary

During this sprint I worked on creating mockups for the initial versions of the aspects of the site that I will be working on. I used figma for this, and initially the first few hours were spent familiarizing myself with figma.

## Notes for next sprint

During the next sprint I will continue to mockup the site, moving on to the UX flow for the dashboard. I hope to complete mockups for all dashboard pages.
