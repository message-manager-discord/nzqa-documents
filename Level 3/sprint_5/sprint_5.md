## Reflection and Summary

### Major Changes and Achievements

- Update site with migration and support docs (finish off docs).
- Investigate monorepo (didn't end up doing this)

### Reflection

This sprint involved a lot of work, that eventuated to not much progress.
This was because a large portion of time was spent on attempting to move to a monorepo, which didn't end up working.

## Testing

Not much public testing, mainly involved private testing making sure everything worked.
The main issue I faces in the monorepo was getting installs working with the monorepo and some of the packages I use were difficult to do this with.

## Notes for next sprint

Next sprint I need to focus on getting stuff done.
