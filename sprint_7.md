### Reflection

I think I did pretty well this sprint, managing to get the release out pretty smoothly, with only a few issues that I sorted out quickly.
This is even though for the first week I was unable to do much work as I caught the flu (the sprint was also extended to the end of the term).

## Testing

There was a lot of testing, and feedback from users this time round.

### Feedback and testing from testers before release

Not much here was actioned, but it did reassure me there weren't any really bad bugs.

### Feedback after release from general users

## Notes for next sprint

Next sprint I need to focus on getting stuff done.
